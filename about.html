      The <a href="http://ohmec.net">OHMEC</a> project is a free,
      open-source geography project, with a goal of representing all
      historical indigenous lands and political boundaries in a unified
      database. The uniqueness of OHMEC is its ability to represent these
      lands and boundaries on any date, as well as being able to show the
      dynamic changes in lands and boundaries from any point in history
      to the present. It is very much a work in progress. This early
      demonstration shows a rendering of data in the North American
      arena using <a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> to display
      geographical polygons from the database, overlaid on top of
      a modern map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The OHMEC project is being developed openly in a
      <a href="https://github.com/ohmec/ohmec" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.
      Participation is welcome, see that repo for more information
      on the management of the project. Also see
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WiXMrLPC4fOwNaKD7UhH2Wb1JSVcva5z4sNdd0qS7vg/edit?usp=sharing">this slidedeck</a>
      for more insight into the project. A specification of the
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15D9t61Y1WYYH02BuIp3C8InJD40L19uHIcPNDfNv0Bk/edit?usp=sharing">extended GeoJSON</a>
      format that underpins the historical database is provided here.

    <h2>Interacting with the map</h2>
    <p>
      Hovering over any polygonal entity provides information about
      the feature in the <i>info box</i> in the upper right. This
      typically includes a link, or multiple links, that the user
      can click on to find out more about the foundation of the
      data. See the <b><i>i</i></b> key below on how to hold the
      info box in order to click the link.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding the shift key down and creating a bounding box will
      redefine the current zoom window. Clicking on a polygon will
      deprioritize it in the "click stack" when there are multiple
      overlapping features, allowing the user to hover over the
      lower ones to see their information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial start date, current date, and end date can be
      modified by typing in a new value into one of the three
      boxes below the map. Hitting enter, tab, or otherwise
      changing focus from the entry form will trigger a reload
      of the current page with the date modified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visualization and control can be modified by key press events.
      The following keys pressed <u>after click-selecting the map
      pane</u> have a particular effect.

          in the current viewpoint. When false, the step buttons simply move
          to the next or previous change in the database.  NOTE the user must

          before any keyboard event.

    <h2>Studies</h2>
    <p>
      There are several <b>special historical studies</b> available
      via the different web pages selectable by the tabs at the top
      of the page. These are described below, as well as the primary
      page.
    </p>
    <h3>Primary</h3>
    <p>
      The primary page is itself a study of the North American
      theater, from the time 1600 to present. This combines information
      on Native North American tribes, Western occupations, and
      Western claims and grants. Most of these are step-wise
      increments of land boundaries as indicated with claims or
      grants. A few are animated to indicate the increase in
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial Native occupations are, in this study, indicated as
      borderless locations static in time. The end date has been
      researched and chosen as the date in which the tribe was given
      reservation land. At that time, reservation boundaries are
      shown equivalent to today's boundaries. For bordered viewpoints,
      see the Native Lands study discussed below. For dynamic
      viewpoints, see the Cherokee and Ancient Americas studies
      discussed below.
    </p>
    <h3>Native Lands</h3>
    <p>
      The Native Lands study swaps out the OHMEC Native tribal
      locations and uses data from the organization
      <a href="http://native-land.ca">Native Land Digital</a>. This
      is a richer dataset that has boundaries that encompass all
      of the tribes' known homelands throughout their history. OHMEC
      would like to work with Native Land Digital to attempt to
      represent movements of the tribes akin to the Cherokee study.
    </p>
    <h3>Ancient Americas</h3>
    <p>
      The Ancient Americas study focuses on the ancient prehistoric
      movements of peoples into the Americas, as best we know through
      modern scholarship. The study at this time focuses on the
      years 22000BC to 10000BC, following the movements of the
      Ancient North Eurasians into Beringia, then the split of the
      Southern Native Americans (SNA) along the Pacific Coast, and
      the Northern Native Americans (NNA, aka Clovis Culture) through
      the parting of the Canadian ice sheets. The fidelity of the
      mapping is highly speculative and is shown for educational
      visualization purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>Cherokee</h3>
    <p>
      The Cherokee study highlights the movements of the Proto-
      Cherokee and Cherokee tribes through the period 800BC to
      present. All other Native tribes are absent in this study.
      Eventually it is desired to have information on all Native
      tribes in this fashion, but this was made possible by a 1990s
      archaeological study.
    </p>
    <h3>Viking</h3>
    <p>
      The Viking study shows a brief highlight of pre-Viking peoples
      in the northern European arena from roughly 15000BC to 6000BC.
      This was an early experiement with modeling tribal movements
      as well as the effect of geographical changes in the form of
      receding ice sheets.
