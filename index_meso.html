      The <a href="http://ohmec.net">OHMEC</a> project is a free,
      open-source geography project, with a goal of representing all
      historical indigenous lands and political boundaries in a unified
      database. The uniqueness of OHMEC is its ability to represent these
      lands and boundaries on any date, as well as being able to show the
      dynamic changes in lands and boundaries from any point in history
      to the present. It is very much a work in progress. This early
      demonstration shows a rendering of historical data in Mesoamerica
      using <a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> to display
      geographical features from the database, overlaid on top of
      a modern map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The OHMEC project is being developed openly in a
      <a href="https://github.com/ohmec/ohmec" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.
      Participation is welcome, see that repo for more information
      on the management of the project. Also see

      for more insight into the project. A specification of the

      This Mesoamerican study focuses on the time period between
      1800 BC and 1600, about 100 years after the first Western
      incursion into the hemisphere. The geographical arena of the
      study is roughly the modern Mexico and Central American
      regions. Clearly the farther back into history the data is,
      the lower the fidelity and confidence. That said, the
      Mesoamerican region is rich with advanced civilizations
      that left many architectural and written records. In addition,
      there were many eyewitnesses to the stark encounters of the
      early Spanish entrants into the homeland of the Aztec, Mayan
      and other existing Mesoamerican civilizations.
