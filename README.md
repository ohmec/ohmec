# ohmec
The OHMEC project has a goal to create an open geographical database of historical representation of political boundaries. 
It is in a nascent stage, using leaflet to demonstrate data stored in a JSON structure that is currently handcrafted.
Contributions are welcome.

An up to date rendering can be found in our [Github Mirror Page](http://ohmec.net).
