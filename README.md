# ohmec
The OHMEC project has a goal to create an open geographical database of historical representation of political boundaries. 
It is in a nascent stage, using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) to visualize data stored in a JSON structure that is currently handcrafted.
Contributions are welcome.

See [this slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WiXMrLPC4fOwNaKD7UhH2Wb1JSVcva5z4sNdd0qS7vg/edit?usp=sharing) for more insight into the project.

A specification of the [extended GeoJSON](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15D9t61Y1WYYH02BuIp3C8InJD40L19uHIcPNDfNv0Bk/edit?usp=sharing) format that underpins the historical database is provided here.

An up to date rendering can be found in our [Github Mirror Page](http://ohmec.net).
